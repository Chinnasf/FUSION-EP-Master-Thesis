#### General Remarks

In this repository, you can see the main progress of my thesis. These analyses are done with the aid of [Prof. Dr. Geert Verdoolaege](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Geert-Verdoolaege) and [PhD Student Joseph Hall](https://telefoonboek.ugent.be/nl/people/802003618944). As I progress on this project, I will be adding more information.


The project consists on investigating why the dependence of the machine size $\alpha_R$, of the energy confinement time:

$$
    \tau_{E,th} = \alpha_0 \cdot I_P^{\alpha_I} \cdot B_t^{\alpha_B} \cdot n^{\alpha_n} \cdot {P_{l,th}}^{\alpha_P} \cdot {R_{geo}}^{\alpha_R} \cdot {\kappa_{a}}^{\alpha_\kappa} \cdot \epsilon^{\alpha_\epsilon} \cdot {M_{eff}}^{\alpha_M},
$$


has decreased with the updated database [DB5 version 2.3](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01m900nx49h) if the standard criterium for selecting the datapoints to apply the regression remains the same. With ITER's design, it was noted that $\alpha_R \sim 2$; now, $\alpha_R \sim 1.4$.
